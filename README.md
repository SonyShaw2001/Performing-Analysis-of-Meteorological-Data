#### (ii) Recognizing Handwritten Digits with Scikit-Learn

The primary aim of this project involves predicting a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font.
we will have an estimator with the task of learning through a fit() function, and once it has reached a degree of predictive capability (a model sufficiently valid), it will produce a prediction with the predict() function.
